Hi!
I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at Stony Brook University, advised by Prof. Arie Kaufman in the Center for Visual Computing.

My research focuses on **Extended Reality (XR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Immersive Analytics**. I design and evaluate **large-scale visualization systems**, developing **AI- and LLM-assisted analytics frameworks, interactive visualization tools, and user-centered XR interfaces**. My work combines techniques from **computer graphics, machine learning, and user experience research** to make immersive environments more **adaptive, explainable, and data-driven**.

My research has been published at venues such as IEEE VR, IEEE VIS and IEEE TVCG.

You can reach me at my [professional email](mailto:zaamir@cs.stonybrook.edu) or my [personal email](mailto:aamirzainab@yahoo.com).
