Hi! 
I am a second year PhD in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, advised by [Prof. Dongyoon Lee](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~dongyoon/). My areas of interest are broadly software and system security. I completed my undergraduate from Lahore University of Management Sciences in Lahore, Pakistan.
