Hi!
I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at Stony Brook University, advised by Prof. Arie Kaufman in the Center for Visual Computing.

My research focuses on Extended Reality (XR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Immersive Analytics. I design and evaluate large-scale visualization systems, developing AI- and LLM-assisted analytics frameworks, interactive visualization tools, and user-centered XR interfaces. My goal is to make immersive environments more adaptive, explainable, and data-driven.

My research has been published at venues such as IEEE VR, IEEE VIS and IEEE TVCG.

You can reach me at my [professional email](mailto:zaamir@cs.stonybrook.edu) or my [personal email](mailto:aamirzainab@yahoo.com).
