My research lies at the intersection of Immersive Visualization, HCI, and AI. I aim to design scalable visualization frameworks that extend the capabilities of reconfigurable display facilities and XR environments. A central focus of my work is integrating LLM- and agent-driven intelligence to better model and support user behavior, making immersive analytics adaptive, explainable, and collaborative.
Alongside systems design, I explore applications of AR for situated visualization, bringing data insights directly into the environments where they matter most. This combination of systems and user-centered evaluation drives my broader goal: making immersive analytics a practical tool for both scientific discovery and real-world decision-making!
